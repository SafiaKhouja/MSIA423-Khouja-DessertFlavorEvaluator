## Running the app
### 1. Initialize the database 

#### Create the database with a single song 
To create the database in the location configured in `config.py` with one initial song, run: 

`python run.py create_db --engine_string=<engine_string> --artist=<ARTIST> --title=<TITLE> --album=<ALBUM>`

By default, `python run.py create_db` creates a database at `sqlite:///data/tracks.db` with the initial song *Radar* by Britney spears. 
#### Adding additional songs 
To add an additional song:

`python run.py ingest --engine_string=<engine_string> --artist=<ARTIST> --title=<TITLE> --album=<ALBUM>`

By default, `python run.py ingest` adds *Minor Cause* by Emancipator to the SQLite database located in `sqlite:///data/tracks.db`.

#### Defining your engine string 
A SQLAlchemy database connection is defined by a string with the following format:

`dialect+driver://username:password@host:port/database`

The `+dialect` is optional and if not provided, a default is used. For a more detailed description of what `dialect` and `driver` are and how a connection is made, you can see the documentation [here](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/engines.html). We will cover SQLAlchemy and connection strings in the SQLAlchemy lab session on 
##### Local SQLite database 

A local SQLite database can be created for development and local testing. It does not require a username or password and replaces the host and port with the path to the database file: 

```python
engine_string='sqlite:///data/tracks.db'

```

The three `///` denote that it is a relative path to where the code is being run (which is from the root of this directory).

You can also define the absolute path with four `////`, for example:

```python
engine_string = 'sqlite://///Users/cmawer/Repos/2020-MSIA423-template-repository/data/tracks.db'
```


### 2. Configure Flask app 

`config/flaskconfig.py` holds the configurations for the Flask app. It includes the following configurations:

```python
DEBUG = True  # Keep True for debugging, change to False when moving to production 
LOGGING_CONFIG = "config/logging/local.conf"  # Path to file that configures Python logger
HOST = "0.0.0.0" # the host that is running the app. 0.0.0.0 when running locally 
PORT = 5000  # What port to expose app on. Must be the same as the port exposed in app/Dockerfile 
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'sqlite:///data/tracks.db'  # URI (engine string) for database that contains tracks
APP_NAME = "penny-lane"
SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = True 
SQLALCHEMY_ECHO = False  # If true, SQL for queries made will be printed
MAX_ROWS_SHOW = 100 # Limits the number of rows returned from the database 
```

### 3. Run the Flask app 

To run the Flask app, run: 

```bash
python app.py
```

You should now be able to access the app at http://0.0.0.0:5000/ in your browser.

## Running the app in Docker 

### 1. Build the image 

The Dockerfile for running the flask app is in the `app/` folder. To build the image, run from this directory (the root of the repo): 

```bash
 docker build -f app/Dockerfile -t pennylane .
```

This command builds the Docker image, with the tag `pennylane`, based on the instructions in `app/Dockerfile` and the files existing in this directory.
 
### 2. Run the container 

To run the app, run from this directory: 

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 --name test pennylane
```
You should now be able to access the app at http://0.0.0.0:5000/ in your browser.

This command runs the `pennylane` image as a container named `test` and forwards the port 5000 from container to your laptop so that you can access the flask app exposed through that port. 

If `PORT` in `config/flaskconfig.py` is changed, this port should be changed accordingly (as should the `EXPOSE 5000` line in `app/Dockerfile`)

### 3. Kill the container 

Once finished with the app, you will need to kill the container. To do so: 

```bash
docker kill test 
```

where `test` is the name given in the `docker run` command.

### Workaround for potential Docker problem for Windows.

It is possible that Docker will have a problem with the bash script `app/boot.sh` that is used when running on a Windows machine. Windows can encode the script wrongly so that when it copies over to the Docker image, it is corrupted. If this happens to you, try using the alternate Dockerfile, `app/Dockerfile_windows`, i.e.:

```bash
 docker build -f app/Dockerfile_windows -t pennylane .
```

then run the same `docker run` command: 

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 --name test pennylane
```

The new image defines the entry command as `python3 app.py` instead of `./boot.sh`. Building the sample PennyLane image this way will require initializing the database prior to building the image so that it is copied over, rather than created when the container is run. Therefore, please **do the step [Create the database with a single song](#create-the-database-with-a-single-song) above before building the image**.
